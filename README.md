# SOSGame
This project is graded based on the development of the SOS game. Two Players aim to create the sequence "S-O-S" on an (n x n) grid system within the games GUI. Players will have the option to either play against an AI model or select an AI vs AI game. The final implementation will contain two game modes: Simple Game and General Game.
